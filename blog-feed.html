    <h3>BOOKLET DESIGN: KLIM TYPE FOUNDRY CASE STUDY</h3>
    <p id="subheading-category">Project Case Study</p>
    <hr id="mini">

    
      <p id="small-text">
      Recently, I designed a 12-page booklet studying the work of Klim Type Foundry. This was done for an assessment at uni. The brief was that we must design and layout a booklet showcasing the work of a type designer. I thoroughly enjoyed this project. After my initial research of Klim Type Foundry I knew that I wanted to design a classy, elegant and minimalistic booklet. I felt that this would strongly resonate with Klim’s style.
      </p>
      <p id="small-text">
      Klim type foundry is a New Zealand based type foundry, operated by Kris Sowersby. They have designed many fabulous typefaces, however I chose to focus mainly on the Domaine font foundry. (I would highly recommend checking out the rest of their work on their website: <a href="https://klim.co.nz">https://klim.co.nz</a> ) They have also done some work designing typefaces for tourism companies where representing the culture of the country through the typeface was highly important. The fonts have been designed for New Zealand, Fiji and the Chatham Islands.
      </p>
      <p id="small-text">
      Overall, I really enjoyed designing this booklet. I hadn’t tested out this type of elegant style to this extent and it’s definitely been my favourite design so far because of the theme.
      </p>
      <p id="small-text">
      We needed to a fair amount of copy throughout the booklet. I wrote the article Who Is Klim? and Designing National Typefaces. I was able to use an interview with Kris Sowersby from the Design Conference in Brisbane in 2018 which I found on Klim’s website. Through these articles I felt I was able to accurately tell the story of Klim’s work and process.
      </p>
      <p id="small-text">
      Below I have attached an image which shows the full layout, as well as plenty of annotations explaining the diffferent design decisions I made throughout the project and why I made them.
