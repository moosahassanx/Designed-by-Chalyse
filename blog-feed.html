	<h3>BOOKLET DESIGN: KLIM TYPE FOUNDRY CASE STUDY</h3>
	<p id="subheading-category">Project Case Study</p>
	<hr id="mini">

	<div class="blogging-container">
		<p id="small-text">
		Recently, I designed a 12-page booklet studying the work of Klim Type Foundry. This was done for an assessment at uni. The brief was that we must design and layout a booklet showcasing the work of a type designer. I thoroughly enjoyed this project. After my initial research of Klim Type Foundry I knew that I wanted to design a classy, elegant and minimalistic booklet. I felt that this would strongly resonate with Klim’s style.
		</p>
    <br>
		<p id="small-text">
			Klim type foundry is a New Zealand based type foundry, operated by Kris Sowersby. They have designed many fabulous typefaces, however I chose to focus mainly on the Domaine font foundry. (I would highly recommend checking out the rest of their work on their website: <a href="https://klim.co.nz">https://klim.co.nz</a> ) They have also done some work designing typefaces for tourism companies where representing the culture of the country through the typeface was highly important. The fonts have been designed for New Zealand, Fiji and the Chatham Islands.
		</p>
    <br>
		<p id="small-text">
			Overall, I really enjoyed designing this booklet. I hadn’t tested out this type of elegant style to this extent and it’s definitely been my favourite design so far because of the theme.
		</p>
    <br>
		<p id="small-text">
			We needed to a fair amount of copy throughout the booklet. I wrote the article Who Is Klim? and Designing National Typefaces. I was able to use an interview with Kris Sowersby from the Design Conference in Brisbane in 2018 which I found on Klim’s website. Through these articles I felt I was able to accurately tell the story of Klim’s work and process.
		</p>
    <br>
		<p id="small-text">
			Below I have attached an image which shows the full layout, as well as plenty of annotations explaining the diffferent design decisions I made throughout the project and why I made them.

  <h3>WHAT I’VE LEARNT THIS SEMESTER…</h3>
  <p id="subheading-category">Project Case Study</p>
  <hr id="mini">

  <div class="blogging-container">
    <p id="small-text">
      This semester I have surprisingly found the Contexts 1002 course to be very interesting. I’ve found that I have previously had a fairly strong interest in modern history, but never in a design sense. It has been extremely interesting this semester relating design history with modern history and learning more about both.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p id="small-text">
      Some things I have found particularly interesting have included how international design has had an effect on the design industry worldwide. I enjoyed learning about how designers have found visual solutions to problems, such as the isotypes as a way of communicating despite language barriers.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p id="small-text">
      I think that learning about problems that designer’s were able to fix that had a significant effect on society has been the most interesting things I have learnt this semester. It has also inspired me to look for problems and consider solutions.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p id="small-text">
      I feel as though I have a much stronger knowledge and understanding of the history of design and this excites me for the future of my design career as I want to continue to learn from the past in order to create a better future.

  <h3>SEVENTY-NINE SHORT ESSAY’S ON DESIGN – MICHAEL BIERUT</h3>
  <p id="subheading-category">Uncategorized</p>
  <hr id="mini">
  <div class="blogging-container">
    <p id="small-text">
      During this semester I went wandering down darby street during one of my breaks at uni. I was planning to go to a cafe but I saw a small bookshop down a side street that intrigued me. I’m not usually one to read many books (something I know needs to change) but for some reason I decided to go in and see what was inside.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p id="small-text">
      It turns out that the bookstore has a fairly strong art and design section. I could have easily spent ages in there looking at all the different design books. I found one in particular that caught my interest, Seventy-nine Short Essays on Design by Michael Bierut.
    </p>
    <br>
    <img src="https://designedbychalysehome.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/79-short-essays-on-design.jpg?w=1024" alt="Seventy-nine short essays on design">
    <p>Pentagram (n.d.). Seventy-nine short essays on design. [image] Available at: https://www.pentagram.com/work/seventy-nine-short-essays-on-design [Accessed 20 Oct. 2019].</p>
    <br>

    <p id="small-text">
      I surprised myself in buying, let alone having read four of the essays within a couple of hours. I honestly felt as though I had been let into a whole other world within design. (also, for the first time I was reading essays that were actually interesting). Something that has resonated with me, (and even weeks after having read the essay it came from) the quote, ‘Not everything is about design, but design is about everything’ has stuck with me. This was a concept that I hadn’t really considered before, but it makes so much sense. I’ve always found that I like to learn about how things work, I don’t really mind what the subject is, but if someone starts explaining how something works I’m all ears and will probably go home and continue to research a particular topic.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p id="small-text">
      For example, I wouldn’t say I am a revhead or anything, but I’ve put myself in a position to learn about how cars work enough times that I feel I have a fairly good idea about how they work. When my car blew a head gasket and dad decided that it was worth trying to fix it ourselves I took every opportunity to watch, help and ask questions about how different parts of the engine work. Whilst I’m definitely no expert I do have a stronger understanding than before. I’d never really though about how this could help me as a designer, but that keeness to learn about different subjects can help a designer to produce some of their best work. As Bierut says in Warning: May Contain Non-Design Content (essay 1) ‘the more things your interested in, the better your work will be.’ (Bierut, 2007) Therefore, as a designer if you can build an interest in topics more easily, you are more likely to design better work.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p id="small-text">
      I would defintely recommend that every designer read this book as it provides valuable insights into the design world and even broader than that.
