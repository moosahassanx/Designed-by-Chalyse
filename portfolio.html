		<p>
			Bellinzona Chocolate is a chocolate brand that embodies the elegance and finesse of an exotic chocolate factory in Switzerland. I wanted the branding to embody the grandeur of the experience of eating this chocolate. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I chose the deep red for the base colour as I felt that it embodied the grandeur of the brand effectively. I wanted to pair this with some lighter colours in order offset the dark colour of the red as well as a metallic colour (featured within the pattern and the logo) in order to embrace the quality of the brand. 
		</p>	
		<p>
			The pattern has been used as a representation of the feel of eating chocolate, and provides an element of fun for the branding whilst still maintaining the elegance. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I made two patterns that I was considering using within the final design. The first is the pattern that I used on my design as some bubbly shapes that loosely represent the joy of eating chocolate. The second was a subtle pattern that I was considering using as a low opacity pattern in the background of the red, however once I had all the elements that I wanted in my final design, I felt like it hindered rather than helped the design.

		<h5>Font</h5>
		<p>
			A description of the project and the works presented. The aim of my font was to be a header font for a website. I wanted it to have a high contrast and a fairly thick weight. The aim was also to have a fairly condensed, balanced font. It was important that the font was even with high readability. I did want to show some personality through the use of ball terminals and hairline serifs.

		<h5>Album Cover Design</h5>
		<p>
			I designed this album cover as though it was a re-release of Olly Murs, Never Been Better album. I have displayed the final version below as well as 2 of my other design possibilities.
